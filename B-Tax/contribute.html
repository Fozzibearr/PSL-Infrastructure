                <p><p>There are two common ways to get started with B-Tax:</p> <p>The <strong>first way</strong> to use B-Tax is to download the source code and install the model on your machine.  To do this, follow the following instructions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Install the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda distribution</a> of Python</p> </li> <li> <p>Clone this repository to a directory on your computer</p> </li> <li> <p>From the terminal (or Conda command prompt), navigate to the directory to which you cloned this repository and run <code>conda env create -f environment.yml</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Then, <code>source activate btax-dev</code> (or <code>activate btax-dev</code> if using a Windows machine)</p> </li> <li> <p>Then install by <code>pip install -e .</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to <code>./run_examples</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Run the model with an example reform from terminal/command prompt by typing <code>python run_btax_example.py</code></p> </li> <li> <p>You can adjust the <code>./run_examples/run_btax_example.py</code> by adjusting the individual income tax reform (using a dictionary or JSON file in a format that is consistent with <a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator">Tax Calculator</a>) or other model parameters specified in the <code>user_params</code> or <code>kwargs</code> dictionaries.</p> </li> <li> <p>Model outputs will be saved in the following files:</p> <ul> <li><code>asset_data.pkl</code><ul> <li>Dataframe with the distribution of assets by industry and tax treatment.  This dataframe is cached in a pickle file to be used in later runs, thereby reducing run time.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/baseline_byasset.csv</code><ul> <li>Cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output for the baseline policy, organized by asset.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/baseline_byindustry.csv</code><ul> <li>Cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output for the baseline policy, organized by production industry.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/reform_byasset.csv</code><ul> <li>Cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output for the reform policy, organized by asset.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/reform_byindustry.csv</code><ul> <li>Cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output for the refrom policy, organized by production industry.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/changed_byasset.csv</code><ul> <li>Differences in cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output between the baseline and reform reform policies, organized by asset.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/changed_byindustry.csv</code><ul> <li>Differences in cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output between the baseline and reform reform policies, organized by production industry.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The CSV output files can be compared to the <code>./run_examples/*_expected.csv</code> files that are checked into the repository to confirm that you are generating the expected output.  If you run into errors running the example script, please open a new issue in the B-Tax repo with a description of the issue and any relevant tracebacks you receive.</p> <p>The <strong>second way</strong> to use B-Tax is through a web application, <a href="http://www.ospc.org/ccc">Cost of Capital Calculator</a>.  This way allows you to generate estimates of marginal effective tax rates and the cost of capital across production industries, type of asset, and separately for corporate and non-corporate entites and different forms of financing.  The web application is limited in that you cannot consider policy reforms to the individual income tax code.</p> <p>Of course, you can get started with B-Tax both ways.</p> </p>
