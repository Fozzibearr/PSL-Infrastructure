# About PSL

The Policy Simulation Library (PSL) is an open source software library for public-policy decision making. The models in PSL are developed by independent projects that conform to [PSL criteria](criteria.html) for transparency. Modeling projects may also adopt PSL's criteria for interoperability and community building, which take the form of suggestions for interface design and organizational activity. PSL aims to grow to span governments and policy domains.

The PSL project, which lives in this repository, sets PSL criteria and develops infrastructure to support PSL.

PSL infrastructure projects under development include:

- A PSL-Catalog of projects and their key attributes, which is automatically constructed by PSL-Core's Catalog-Builder tool.
- The policysimulationlibrary.org website to host general Library information and the PSL-Catalog.
- Broadcast-Recipes for disseminating updates about the projects to users.
- A privacy-granting service to repost user questions on our community message boards. For example, "A Congressional user from an important committee would like to know _____."
