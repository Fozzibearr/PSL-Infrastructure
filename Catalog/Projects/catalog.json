Careful documentation of the model--its output, and solution method--is available <a href=\"https://github.com/rickecon/OG-USA/blob/doc/documentation/OGUSAdoc.pdf\">here</a> and is regularly updated.</p>"

THE CODE SHOULD NOT CURRENTLY BE USED FOR PUBLICATIONS, JOURNAL ARTICLES, OR RESEARCH PURPOSES. Essentially, you should assume the calculations are unreliable until we finish the code re-architecture and have checked the results against other existing implementations of the tax code. The package will have released versions, which will be checked against existing code prior to release. Stay tuned for an upcoming release!</p>"
