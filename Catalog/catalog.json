This way allows you to generate estimates of marginal effective tax rates and the cost of capital across production industries, type of asset, and separately for corporate and non-corporate entites and different forms of financing.  The web application is limited in that you cannot consider policy reforms to the individual income tax code.</p> <p>Of course, you can get started with B-Tax both ways.</p>"
